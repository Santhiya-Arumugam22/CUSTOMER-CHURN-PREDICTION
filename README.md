# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

Overview:
  Customer churn prediction using machine learning is a powerful approach that leverages computational techniques to analyze and interpret historical customer data. This project focuses on developing a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business, using features such as usage behavior and customer demographics.

Objective:
  The primary goal of this project is to contribute to the reduction of customer churn by enabling timely intervention and personalized customer retention strategies. By utilizing historical customer data, the machine learning model aims to learn patterns and relationships within the data, allowing it to accurately predict which customers are likely to churn.

Dataset:
  The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset that includes relevant features such as customer usage behavior, demographics, and labels indicating whether each customer has churned. The dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning model. The dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction

Data Preprocessing:
  Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes a thorough preprocessing phase. This involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and performing any other necessary steps to ensure the data is suitable for training a machine learning model.

Libraries:
  The following libraries were used in this project:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
sklearn
matplotlib

Machine Learning Model:
  The machine learning models employed in this project are:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
The choice of model depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the churn prediction task.

Training:
The model is trained on a subset of the dataset, where it learns to recognize patterns and relationships between input features and churn outcomes. During the training phase, hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance.

Evaluation:
To assess the model's effectiveness, various evaluation metrics are used. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance in predicting customer churn.
